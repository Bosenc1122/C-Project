# Overview

C# project for CSE 310. I created a choose your own adventure text story in C#. It was helpful for me to learn how to use C# in a fun way and
to be interested in what I am coding.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to write this program and the C# library and code.


# Useful Websites

Below are a few useful websites for learning C# and getting better at it.

# Future Work

Below is a list of a few thing I would do in the future to make the code better.

- Item 1 Make the story longer so it is more fun to play.
- Item 2 Find a way to input sound to the choices to make the experience better.
- Item 3 Find a way to add images to the story to make it better as well.
